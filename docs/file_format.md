# File format

Here is an example of json file with information about some Home Assistant card:

```json
{
    "card_id" : "af4684002036",
    "image" : "https://upload.bessarabov.ru/bessarabov/QjyEHqSWitD1m2V3CuUdJNNFGBo.png",
    "name" : "animated-consumption-card",
    "repo" : {
        "clone_url" : "https://github.com/bessarabov/animated-consumption-card.git",
        "type" : "github"
    },
    "site" : "https://github.com/bessarabov/animated-consumption-card",
    "status" : "active"
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `card_id` | This is the main id for the card. It is unique. It is autogenerated. There is no hidde info in it, it is just a random string. The length if always 12. In this string there can by only digits from 0 to 9 and lowercase letters from "a" to "f".  |
| `site` | The url with the info about this card created by the author. Usually it is a link to GitHub repo. There can be situations when several cards have the same `site`, when there is one page with information about several cards, but this situation is seldom. |
| `name` | The name of the card. This is always the string that is used when the card is added to Home Assistant UI (`- type: 'custom:animated-consumption-card'`) but without `custom:`. There can be situations where two or more cards have the same `name`. For example an original card and a popular fork. |
| `status` | The string `active` or `deprecated`. Status `deprecated` is used only when there is information in thre repositorey that this project is deprecated and/or the GitHub repo is archived. If there is no such info in the repo the status stays `active`, even if there is no recent commits. |
| `image` | Url with the card sample image. The format must be `png`. This field is optional. |
| `repo` | This is an optinal field. The value is the json object with data about the repo. In that object there must be field `type`. Other fields in the objects depends of the `type`. Now there is only one possible `type`: `github`, but in the future other types can be introduced. |

## `repo` with type `github`

`"type" : "github"` means that the source code for this card is sotred in GitHub repo and there is only one UI card in that repo.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | `github` |
| `clone_url` | This is a direct url that can be used in `git clone` command. It should be https url, not git url. |

## Note about file paths

The path for the json file is generated from `card_id`.

Card with `card_id` `af4684002036` is stored in this repo at `data/a/f/4684002036.json`.
Under the `data/` folder there are subfolder by first & second symbol from `card_id`.

Such file structure is chosen to prevent storing a lot of files in one folder.

This idea was borrowed from the way version control system git stores its data.
